# 📦 Hyperlocal Delivery Platform Database – Full SQL Server Project

This repository showcases a complete SQL-based backend architecture for a **Hyperlocal Delivery System**, inspired by real-world platforms such as **Zepto**, **Dunzo**, and **Blinkit**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Design a scalable and normalized database structure  
- Insert real-world sample data (users, vendors, products, orders)  
- Write powerful SQL queries for business analytics  
- Create Views, Indexes, Triggers, and Stored Procedures  
- Optimize database performance  
- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
- Automate daily tasks with SQL Server Agent Jobs  
- Send scheduled notifications (like Zomato reminders)  
- Build an optional frontend using Python and Streamlit for live data interaction
